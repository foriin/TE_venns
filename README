Venn Diagrams for Common Active TE insertions
https://thenotoriousmbg.shinyapps.io/te_venns/

Overview

This repository contains a Shiny app designed to visualize and analyze common transposable element insertions in Drosophila tissues. The analysis includes three Drosophila tissues, one of which was subjected to either control conditions or piRNA pathway knockdown.

Usage

1. Select samples you want to investigate. The numbers in each region represent the number of insertions (shared or not)
2. Hover your mouse over the active insertion number in each sample to view all the TEs that active insertions correspond to.
